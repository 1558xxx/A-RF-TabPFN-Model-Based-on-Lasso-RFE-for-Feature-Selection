First, please download all relevant source code and dataset files from the aforementioned GitHub repository (note that the original data, due to its large size, is hosted on IEEE DataPort). Subsequently, create a Python virtual environment (version 3.9.21) using Anaconda, and install all required dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt file provided in the repository. Furthermore, ensure that the downloaded code files and the original data files are located in the same directory to guarantee that the program can correctly read the input data and execute the intended processing procedures.

Thank you for your valuable suggestions and attention. The resource comparison experiment and ablation study were both conducted based on the Sample_Data dataset. We have placed Resource1, ablation2, and the dataset files in the same folder, allowing the code to run directly. By simply setting up an Anaconda virtual environment and installing the dependencies listed in requirements.txt, the experiments can be reproduced without any additional configuration.

I would sincerely appreciate it if you could kindly complete the review at your earliest convenience. This paper is of great significance to me. In order to supplement the experiments and revise the manuscript, I have averaged only five hours of sleep per day this week. It serves as a crucial supporting document for an important academic selection I am participating in, and I truly hope for your understanding and support.

Thank you once again for your time and effort.
