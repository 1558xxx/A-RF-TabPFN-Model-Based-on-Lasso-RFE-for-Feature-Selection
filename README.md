First, please download all relevant source code and dataset files from the aforementioned GitHub repository (note that the original data, due to its large size, is hosted on IEEE DataPort). Subsequently, create a Python virtual environment (version 3.9.21) using Anaconda, and install all required dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt file provided in the repository. Furthermore, ensure that the downloaded code files and the original data files are located in the same directory to guarantee that the program can correctly read the input data and execute the intended processing procedures.

Thank you for your valuable comments. The resource comparison experiment and ablation study were conducted on the Sample_Data dataset. We have placed Resource1 and ablation2 in the same folder. The code can be run directly by simply creating an Anaconda virtual environment and installing the required dependencies from requirements.txt, without any additional configuration.
